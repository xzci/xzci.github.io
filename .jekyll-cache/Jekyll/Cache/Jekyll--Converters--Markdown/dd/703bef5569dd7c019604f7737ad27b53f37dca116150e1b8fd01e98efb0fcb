I"J<p>This Blog mainly focus on learning JavaScript, I used <strong>JavaScript: THe Definitive Book</strong> to study JavaScript. Because lots of people call this book JavaScriptâ€™s Bible. 
I quickly read 5 chapters of this book, I think JavaScript is much like Java, but still has some differences. I will write down some notes which I think them are so important that I need to remember them, and some difference from other Object-oriented -languages, like Java or even C++.  <strong>last update: 19_06_14</strong></p>
