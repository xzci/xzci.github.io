I think this notes may help me to get better understanding of R.

# help

You can type these codes to help you to understand the function which R is provided


```r
# get the help of function
help(functionName)
# get the args of one function
args(functionName)
# get example of one function
example(functionName)

# Or you can use opeaator '?' which is same as help
?functionname
```

Or perhaps you don't know the exactly name of function, you can use these:

```r
help.search(partOfFunctionName)
# Or
??partOfFunctionName
```

If you want some details, or your computer dosen't have the document of R. you can type this code:

```r
RSiteSearch(functionName)
```
