This Blog mainly focus on learning JavaScript, I used __JavaScript: THe Definitive Book__ to study JavaScript. Because lots of people call this book JavaScript's Bible. 
I quickly read 5 chapters of this book, I think JavaScript is much like Java, but still has some differences. I will write down some notes which I think them are so important that I need to remember them, and some difference from other Object-oriented -languages, like Java or even C++.  __last update: 19_06_14__
